# Dynasty Daddy Stream Suite

A simple Python tool that connects to OBS using WebSocket and dynamically updates:

- Player name, team, and stats (text sources)  
- Player image (image source)  
- Overlay background color (via hex code from API using a color filter)  

Perfect for fantasy football, live streams, or sports podcasts!

## ‚úÖ Requirements

### OBS Setup

  (If you're using OBS 28+, WebSocket is built-in)

Then:

1. Open OBS  
2. Go to **Tools ‚Üí WebSocket Server Settings**  
3. Enable WebSocket server  
4. Note the port (default: 4455) and password

## ‚ùî How to use

After connected, you can select a player to show stats and info about that player. Search for players and queue players up so you can just press show next to update your overlays.

Here's what a queue looks like when building a show sheet...

### Examples

Here's a very simple example that displays name, trade value, player & team image, and a table of stats. After configuring OBS by naming the fields to match the table below I can now populate information with ease.

(Here are my sources)

Let's select Jayden Daniels from the tool, and this is what I see.

Now let's select Malik Nabers. With not changes to my overlay, everything updates automatically!

(Note: I changed the table to be season gamelogs here)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration with .env File
You can configure the connection to your OBS WebSocket server by creating a `.env` file in the project root directory.

Create `.env` file from the `.env.template`.
Add the following variables:

```
OBS_HOST=localhost
OBS_PORT=4455
OBS_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

OBS_HOST: The hostname or IP address of your OBS WebSocket server (usually localhost if running locally)
OBS_PORT: The port number of the WebSocket server (default is 4455)
OBS_PASSWORD: The password you set for your OBS WebSocket server (can be empty if no password set)

### Running the project

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Build a standalone executable with:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "static;static" --icon=static/favicon.ico dynasty_daddy_stream_tools.py
```
